## Introduction

Breaking into a saturated market is never easy—especially with fragmented data. AfriFoods Ltd. plans to launch RizoStar, a premium rice brand, in Ghana and Nigeria by June 2025. This project transforms messy market data into sharp, strategic insights to guide a confident market entry.



## Problem Statement

AfriFoods faces four key challenges:  
- Poor data quality  
- Dominant competitors (Caprice, Golden Harvest, Uncle Sam)  
- Limited customer insight  
- A fast-approaching launch deadline  

**The core question:** How can AfriFoods leverage limited and inconsistent data to choose the right city, price point, grain type, and timing for RizoStar’s launch?

- Analyze pricing tiers, satisfaction trends, and seasonality  
- Identify underserved market segments for premium positioning  
- Generate actionable, data-backed launch recommendations



## Methodology

1. Data Collection & Cleaning  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Customer Segmentation & Competitor Analysis  
4. Predictive Revenue Modeling  
5. Insight Synthesis  
6. Strategic Roadmap Formulation
